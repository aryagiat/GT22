Game Description:
GT22 is an endless runner car racing game. The goal of the game is to overtake as many cars in front without crashing.

Game Rule:
There are three lanes in which the player will be on one of the lanes. There will be incoming traffic randomly appearing in one of the three lanes. Overtake the incoming cars by dodging the traffic. Each car dodged results in an additional point. The run ends when the player crashes the car with the incoming traffic.
